## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Karate Club graph, which represents the social interactions within a karate club. The graph consists of 34 nodes and 78 edges, capturing the relationships between club members.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Usage

To use this project, simply run the provided Python script. The script performs various analyses and generates visualizations of the Karate Club graph.

```bash
python karate_club_analysis.py
```

## Analysis

### Node Degree and Average Degree

The degree of each node and the average degree of the graph are calculated to understand the connectivity of the network.

### Special Graphs

Examples of special graphs, such as complete graphs and star graphs, are examined to understand different network structures.

### Connectivity

The connectivity of the graph is analyzed to determine if the network is fully connected.

### Matrix Representation

The adjacency matrix of the graph is generated to represent the network in matrix form.

### Graph Representation

The graph is represented using edge lists and adjacency lists to facilitate various types of analysis.

### Quantifying Social Structure

Clustering coefficients are calculated to quantify the tendency of nodes to cluster together.

### Centrality Measures

Various centrality measures, including degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, are computed to identify the most important nodes in the network.

### Visualizations

The graph is visualized using different layouts and color schemes to highlight important aspects such as centrality measures and community structure.

## Development

This project is under active development and will continue to be refined and expanded until the final presentation day. Further improvements will be made to enhance the analysis and visualization techniques.
